**SYNTHIA: The SYNTHetic collection of Imagery and Annotations** is a dataset for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 284700 images with 13259180 labeled objects belonging to 18 different classes including *road*, *sky*, *car*, and other: *vegetation*, *fence*, *sidewalk*, *building*, *pole*, *pedestrian*, *terrain*, *traffic sign*, *traffic light*, *bicycle*, *void*, *van*, *truck*, *wheelchair*, and *cyclist*.

Images in the SYNTHIA-AL dataset have . All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (192950 images) and *test* (91750 images). Additionally, original images and depth imagesare grouped by ***im_id***. Also every image contains information about its ***subfolder***. Explore it in supervisely labeling tool. Each bbox label contain its ***observation angle*** tag. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Computer Vision Center, Univ. Autonoma of Barcelona.
